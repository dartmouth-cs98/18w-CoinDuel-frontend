# CoinDuel

FanDuel meets cryptocurrency â€“ Teaching people how to invest, one CapCoin at a time.

CoinDuel will be an application dedicated to educating investors about the volatility and value of cryptocurrencies in a safe setting where they can learn more about the blockchain, as well as learn to perform their own research and generate their own investment theses in order to participate in fun one-week challenge style format games to determine who can pick the best portfolio of currencies.

A couple of applications that inspired our app were HQ trivia, whose UI and payout method we hope to incorporate into our own application to some extent. Also, we hope emulate the simplicity and elegance of RobinHood in teaching people to invest in cryptocurrencies. Finally, we believe that creating a self sustaining economy built around CapCoin (name in progress) where our own psuedo-cryptocurrency acts as a rewards system within the app and can be redeemed to waive buy ins and for other rewards will lead to stickier users - this is similar to the model that SweatCoin followed, which was for a time the number one free app, despite the fact that SweatCoin was not actually built on the blockchain and was simply a cleverly named points system.
