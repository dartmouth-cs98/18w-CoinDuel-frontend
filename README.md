## Problem Statement

Many working professionals and young adults are intimidated by the financial markets and investing, due to its complexity and perceived inaccessibility. Everyone knows that you should save as much as possible – but the reality of the situation is that it’s hard to invest small amounts of money, and no one wants to throw thousands of dollars towards something they don’t fully understand. We are attempting to create a fun, free game that will allow users to gain more exposure and learn more about saving/investing.

## Impact


This project simultaneously teaches users to invest money in the US stock market, while also incentivizing participation by making it free to play. Prior to the existence of Robinhood, which implemented a feeless and free stock trading platform, many students and young adults had few avenues to learn to invest. However, despite a glossy user interface, Robinhood does little to teach users how to invest money and appropriately allocate money across a set of stocks. We plan on teaching users how to invest by allowing them to play without paying money. We hope to combine FanDuel with stock investing with an HQ style interface.  

## Prior Work



FanDuel
DraftKings
iPoll
SwagBucks
Stash
Robinhood
Motif
HQ

Our product is different from sites like FanDuel and DraftKings in that it is free to play. It is different from iPoll, SwagBucks and HQ, sites that let users earn money for free, in that our app is a financial literacy-focused game where users can learn useful information instead of having to view product advertisements or answer trivia questions. Lastly, though Motif and Robinhood are also apps centered on stock market investing, with those applications you have to commit real money.

## Proposed Solution

Briefly describe your proposed solution.  How does it work and what does it do?

## Team

Kooshul Jhaveri - product management & design, can do both front and back end; can create/assign modules; prefer to be working on distinct features/modules to code alone
Josh Kerber - lead developer, can crank out large features quickly and learn new technologies easily
Rajiv Ramaiah - code solo or pair program, iOS experience, design, UI/UX
Henry Wilson - knowledgeable about backend development and working with various APIs
Mitch Revers - experience with mobile apps, work alone towards specific goals
Anish Chadalavada - front-end design, feature idea generation, code together

## Strategy

Development Strategy for MVP:
Build out onboarding and sign-in features
Develop one tab/page for entering weekly game and submitting ‘lineups’
Create a display tab for users to monitor their portfolio throughout the week, as well as their standing and the leaderboard
Integration of payments for the winners, from the app’s account to the winners’ accounts (either PayPal or Venmo)
Link in news, financial data/charts, and other analysis about the particular stocks for a given week from a variety of sources
	
Possible extension features:
Ability for a user to create private leagues with other users, with customizable rules and time periods
Community forums for people to discuss strategy and the best lineup for the week
Integration with Robinhood / Acorn / other apps for users to learn even more and be more active/aware in their financial planning

Testing:
	After testing the MVP app in our six-person group, we plan to further test our product by inviting a number of our friends to download the beta version and play the weekly games, and to let us know of any bugs or confusions in UI/usage that arise. We also plan to ask them to fill out a form for suggestions for improvements and new features.

## Implementation Challenges


We need to pay winners of each weekly match using some means of P2P transaction, possibly Apple Pay which provides several different methods using fingerprints, face recognition, etc. In order to make the app sustainable, we may have to use ads to generate some revenue for cash rewards. We will also have to find a stock market data API and update each player’s balance in real time, which could become costly if we use an API that charges for each call. In addition, none of us are experienced iOS programmers, so there will be some initial learning curve as we learn this new technology.

## Meeting Schedule


Three times a week, Wednesday, Thursday class, and Saturday
